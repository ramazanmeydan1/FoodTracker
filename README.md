In this project, I aimed to calculate the salt and calorie content of consumed foods using the dependency injection design pattern.
With dependency injection, if I want to add other ratios in the contents of these foods and beverages, I can easily do so.
Additionally, adding new foods and beverages is extremely easy.
In the next stage, I plan to convert this into a Windows application and make it SQL-connected
